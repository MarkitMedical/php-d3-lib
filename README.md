# php-d3-lib

A PHP Library for implementing d3.js functionality.

**Master Branch is latest stable release.**
**The current development branch is v1.1  This is still very early stage.**

**How it works**
This PHP library was created to make it easier for PHP devs to quickly spin up a chart with minimal effort and little to no interaction with the actual javascript.

Simply put, this library creates the d3.js javascript for you based on your PHP inputs into the D3 class.

**Examples**

**Additional Info**

Feel free to fork this project and make some cool stuff with it.  It is still early stage but I welcome help from the dev community both on the d3.js side and the PHP side.
